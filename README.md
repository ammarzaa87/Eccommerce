The index.php page is a login page, if a new user enters to this website he must press create your account,
so he redirected to signup.php and fill his information.

when he finishes the form he will directed to admin.php and inside it he can add items with images and he can see items that he have.
2- if he state that he is customer so he will directed to welcome.php inside it a cards of the available stores, if he press on a certain store,
he will directed to products available by this store. and finally he can buy an item by pressing on shopping-bag when he hovers over the image.
